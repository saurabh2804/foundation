## Asset Category

First step towards asset management, is creating Asset Category based on the type of assets. For example, all your desktops and laptops can be part of an Asset Category named "Electronic Equipments".

In Asset Category, you can set default depreciation method, periodicity and depreciation related accounts, which will be applicable to all the assets under the category.
